  _<h1>Artist Statement</h1>_
  <p>My work in class is very in other words mediocre as I can say but I still try to make the effort to put some sort of art that can actually catch an eye. Ever since joining this class, I have been able to create different types of art works that I would never have been to make. The one that I am especially amazed to have learned but still can use some work is this portfolio that by coding. This portfolio is very basic but over time and more work, I will be able to create better work while still being able to create a better portfolio layout which will make me look back and think how amazing learning this from class was. </p>
  <p>On a very different field, I added three images that come from my work as a photographer and it is what I am most passionate about. My actual work in photography consist of a variety of different color usage and also a sort of dark contrast to most of my work. I focus more on a focal point of first person perspective consisting of looking at a person for their beauty and first glimpse as you could say. The main workings of portrait photography is to capture the moment of a person for who they are and also I even add some composition that makes my images more pleasing towards the eye. The first image that is shown by me, is an image named "Poolside" which is posed as someone laying on a poolside chair underwater for the purpose of meaning, "drowning in your own thoughts even if you are just relaxing". Next, my second composite was named "Reflections" because I wanted to show that true beauty should be seen no matter what way you look at yourself whether it's someone's view of you or in a reflection. Lastly, the third image capture is a candid shot, with the use of soft colors that blend together to create a very eye pleasing image which was named "Stoney" in appreciation to music artist "Post Malone".
